# MORSE-CODE-DECODER-AND-ENCODER
This project is a Morse Code Encoder and Decoder developed in C, capable of translating English text into Morse code and converting Morse code back into English. The program provides a user-friendly menu that prompts the user to select the desired operation, after which it calls the appropriate function—engToMorse() for encoding or morseToEng() for decoding. Each function processes user input efficiently and ensures accurate translation between formats. Additionally, the program maintains a complete history of all translations by recording both the original input and the translated output into a text file using file handling techniques. This project demonstrates practical usage of functions, conditional logic, and file I/O in C programming.
